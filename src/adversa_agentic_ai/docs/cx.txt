She comes across the New Adversarial Agentic AI system for validating HIPAA compliance
Janet seeks out to evaluate the service and gets access for the trial version.
Janet wants to try this service on one ER facility which provides the baseline for all ER facilities she owns.
She learns that she has to model the ER facility, configure a set of AI Agents, start a simulation and then wait for the service results.
Janet models one of her ER facilty by first identifying the important entities, their attributes and capabilities. 
She uses the new service interface to define a set of nodes that make up the ER facility, and configures their properties
She then selects two types of LLM Agents
